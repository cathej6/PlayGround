## Overview ##
Our team aims to solve the problem that many parents are very busy at work, so that their children are not receiving enough guidance and companionship. We developed an Android educational game application that allows parents to have a safe mind to let their 6 to 8 years old kids play independently while providing children a fun and engaging game to play with. Parents can select learning objectives from a list of soft skills for their kids to learn and track kidsâ€™ playing progress. Children can learn the skills while building their own story and playing mini games.
