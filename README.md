# PlayGround
## Overview ##
Our team aims to solve the problem that many parents are very busy at work, so that their children are not receiving enough guidance and companionship. We developed an Android educational game application that allows parents to have a safe mind to let their 6 to 8 years old kids play independently while providing children a fun and engaging game to play with. Parents can select learning objectives from a list of soft skills for their kids to learn and track kidsâ€™ playing progress. Children can learn the skills while building their own story and playing mini games.

## Major technology decisions ##
* After doing some research into different educational applications out there we have decided to go with a mobile application for our product, because our application design of mini games and small stories makes it ideal for a mobile application where you only have a few minutes in between activities to explore the game.
* We will most likely be developing our application for Android devices. In addition we will most likely use the platform version Lollipop (5.0-5.1) while also taking advantage of the latest APIs (see [here](http://https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) for source) to create our functional gaming application.
